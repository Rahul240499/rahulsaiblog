I am a Computer Science student :man_technologist: who is passionate about **AI** and its applications. (By the way, I am also interested in emojis :upside_down_face:⁣ and the different ways I can use them. Just kidding! :wink:... or am I? :raised_eyebrow: ). I have been learning & practicing AI and its subdomains for the past 2.5 years and want to excel :rocket: in it.  I think AI is going to transform the world in the same way **Telecom** :artificial_satellite: & **IT** :computer: revolution did. So, I want to be part of this world-changing :world_map: revolution and contribute towards it. I want to use the power of AI in the field of **Web :globe_with_meridians:** & **Game :video_game:** Development and want to make **~~world-changing~~** ***simple applications that can change the world around me***.
